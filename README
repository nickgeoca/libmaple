Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo is a work in progress for a libmaple port to the SiM3U1 MCU (ARM M3). 

If your interested in contributing to the Silabs based project then email me at nickgeoca@gmail.com. Leaflabs is kind enough to acomodate Silabs in their libraries (thanks Leaflabs!) and we follow their standards. See the resources below:

The readme has the following instructions:
 * Wiring Installation
 * Silabs Bugs
 * libmaple Port Tasks
 

Wiring Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Steps
  1) Download repo
  2) Flash bootloader and Wiring app
  3) Install unix toolchain
  4) Modify Wiring code!
 
 * Download repo
   * Download this repo. Use the first half of the instructions under the "Fetch libmaple and Compiler Toolchain" section at this link: http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/leaflabs/maple-docs/snapshots/2012-09-04/unix-toolchain-win-setup.html#id1
 
 * Flash bootloader and Wiring app
   * Connect the board to the PC with the debugger (powered on).
   * Open a command prompt and cd to the repo. 
   * Flash the bootloader and verify it runs:
     * Run this command in the prompt: Si32FlashUtility/Si32FlashUtility -i si_boot.hex
	 * Verify the LED blinks (it's brief)
   * Flash the test Wiring app and verify it runs:
     * Run this command in the prompt: Si32FlashUtility/Si32FlashUtility -i si_wiring.hex
	 * Verify the LED blinks intermittently and UART (9600 baud, no flow ctrl) is spitting out data on D0/D1. J17 and J18 should select UART for D0/D1.
 
 * Install unix toolchain
   * Follow the instructions at this link: http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/leaflabs/maple-docs/snapshots/2012-09-04/unix-toolchain-win-setup.html#id1
   * Replace the unix toolchain with the code red tools. Copy and paste code red into toolchain directory
   * Verify it works. cd into the repo and run this command to clean, make, and flash all in one command: cs-make clean; cs-make -j3; Si32FlashUtility/Si32FlashUtility -i build/si_arduino.hex
   * Result should be a successful build and flash.  
   
 * Modify Wiring Code!
   * Change main.cpp and board.h
   * For now the crossbar is static. A more powerful implementation will be done in the future. To change, goto gpio init function in gpio.c under /libmaple/sim3u1/
