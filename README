Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo is a work in progress for a libmaple port to the SiM3U1 MCU (ARM M3). 

If your interested in contributing to the Silabs based project then email me at nickgeoca@gmail.com. Leaflabs is kind enough to acomodate Silabs in their libraries (thanks Leaflabs!) and we follow their standards. See the resources below:

The readme has the following instructions:
 * Bootloader Installation
 * Wiring Installation
 * Silabs Bugs
 * libmaple Port Tasks
 
 
Bootloader Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Steps
  1) Download repository
  2) Flash Bootloader
  3) Test Bootloader
  
	* Download Repository
		* Download this repo using Git. 
		* (Here's one Git Client for Windows: http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
 
	* Flash Bootloader
		* Connect the board to the PC with the debugger, then power on.
		* Flash the bootloader by running the Si32Flash_boot.bat file located in \GitHub\libmaple\Si32FlashUtility\
		* Verify the LED blinks when it starts
 
	* Test Bootloader
		* Connect the board to the PC with the debugger, then power on.
		* Flash the test program on the board by running the Si32Flash_wiring.bat file located in \GitHub\libmaple\Si32FlashUtility\
		* Restart the board and verify the test app operates as follows:
			* LED blinks intermittently
			* UART (115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit, no flow control) is spitting out data on D0/D1. J17 and J18 should select UART for D0/D1. 
 
 
Wiring Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Steps
  1) Install unix toolchain
  2) Modify Wiring code!
 
 * Install unix toolchain
   * Follow the instructions at this link: http://static.leaflabs.com/pub/leaflabs/maple-docs/snapshots/2012-09-04/unix-toolchain-win-setup.html#id1
   * Replace the unix toolchain with the code red tools. Copy and paste code red into toolchain directory
   * Verify it works. cd into the repo and run this command to clean, make, and flash all in one command: cs-make clean; cs-make -j3; Si32FlashUtility/Si32FlashUtility -i build/si_arduino.hex
   * Result should be a successful build and flash.  
   
 * Modify Wiring Code!
   * Change main.cpp and board.h
   * For now the crossbar is static. A more powerful implementation will be done in the future. To change, goto gpio init function in gpio.c under /libmaple/sim3u1/
